# XO Simulator

Version 0.01 - Essentially a "one-button test" to make sure I know wtf I'm actually doing.  At this point, I'm essentially playing with the data types, how to parse arrays, etc.  I've noticed that C# wants you to put an 'F' after each floating decimal number, even though one might think that to be a bit intuitive, but it seems like even if you declare a variable to be a float, it'll consider a value as a double if you don't and you'll get a nasty-gram from Visual Studio and get your feelings hurt.
